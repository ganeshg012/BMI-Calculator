## 📦 How It Works

1. **Enter Details**  
   Users enter their height (in cm or meters) and weight (in kg) into the input fields.

2. **Calculate BMI**  
   JavaScript reads the inputs, performs the BMI calculation, and updates the results on the page without reloading.

3. **Show Category**  
   Based on the BMI result, the app shows the corresponding health category (e.g., Underweight, Healthy, Overweight).

4. **Task List UI**  
   The page includes a task list section where users can:
   - Add new tasks.
   - Edit existing tasks.
   - Delete tasks dynamically.
   These are all handled by JavaScript DOM manipulation.
